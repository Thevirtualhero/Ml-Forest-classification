History rewrite completed — important collaborator notice

What changed

- A history-preserving cleanup was performed using git-filter-repo and a mirror-push. The following large files were removed from the repository history:
  - `ML DataSet.csv`
  - `best_knn_model.pkl`
  - `data.pkl`
  - `model.pkl`

- A cleaned history was force-pushed to the remote. Backup refs (refs/original) were created during the filter process and were then removed from the remote.

Why we did this

- GitHub rejected pushes due to very large files in repository history (>100 MB). To make the remote usable and avoid future push rejections, we removed those blobs from the history.

What you need to do (recommended)

The rewrite changed commit history. To avoid problems with dangling or diverging branches, follow one of these safe approaches.

Recommended: fresh clone (simplest and safest)

1. Remove any uncommitted local changes or archive them.
2. Delete your existing local clone (or move it aside).
3. Clone the cleaned remote:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Thevirtualhero/Ml-Forest-classification.git
```

4. Continue working on the newly cloned repository as normal.

Alternative: keep local clone and reset

If you must keep your local clone (advanced), do the following to reset your branches to the cleaned remote heads. This will discard local commits that don’t exist in the new remote history.

```powershell
# fetch cleaned refs and prune deleted remote branches
git fetch origin --prune

# for each branch you want to keep, force-reset it to the remote
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# example for another branch
git checkout clean-main
git reset --hard origin/clean-main
```

If you have local changes you want to preserve, create patches from them (git format-patch) before running reset, then apply after re-clone.

Notes & follow-ups

- If you need to recover the original history, it is no longer on the remote (refs/original were removed). If an offline backup exists (e.g., any developer's local clone that still contains the old objects), we can reconstruct, but by default the remote no longer exposes the old blobs.

- To avoid this in the future, please use Git LFS for large datasets and binary models. I can help add a `.gitattributes` and initial Git LFS setup if you want.

Contact / verification

- If you’d like, I can: re-clone the remote here to show the absence of the large files, add Git LFS, or create a small CONTRIBUTING.md describing the workflow for large files.
